### What is Unit Testing?

A unit test is a kind of test that aims to cover the application's functionality at the most *basic level possible*. It
is very **imperative** to **test every single unit of code**, usually a function or a method, in isolation. This is in
order to determine if it will perform as expected under certain circumstances. As soon as you break testing down to this
level, you can be confident that each part of the application will behave as expected.

You'll be able to include edge cases where the unexpected happens, and will be prepared to handle them accordingly.

To put it another way, a unit test is a piece of code which imports parts of the code with the business logic and
executes that logic, asserting multiple scenarios with the idea of guaranteeing certain conditions. There are some
traits that unit tests must have, such as:

- `Isolation`:In order to ensure that unit tests are completely independent of any external agents, they have to focus
  solely on the business logic that needs to be tested. In order to take advantage of this feature, they do not use a
  database, they do not execute HTTP requests, and so forth. In order to achieve isolation, the tests must also be
  independent among themselves: they must be able to run in any order and without being dependent on anything that might
  have happened previously.
- `Performance`: It is essential that unit tests run as quickly as possible. It is intended to run these programs
  multiple times, repeatedly in order to obtain the best results.
- `Repeatability`: As far as the software is concerned, unit tests must be able to objectively assess the status of the
  software in a deterministic manner. This means that the test results should be able to be repeated by the same tester
  again and again. Whenever a unit test fails, the test must keep failing until the code is fixed, as this is how unit
  tests assess the status of the code. If a test passes and no changes are made to the code, then the test should be
  expected to pass in the future. It is critical that your tests are not flaky or random in any way.
- `Self-validating`: In order for a unit test to produce a result, it must be executed. The process of completing the
  form should not require any additional steps; It is much easier to interpret the unit test (much less manual
  intervention is required).

### What Should You Test?

One of the most common questions that many developers ask, especially when they are just starting out, is what should I
test first? It is a legitimate question, and it is also one that is interesting, because the applications that are being
built today are often vast and have many complexities to them. As you know, unit testing makes it a lot easier to do
this task. This is because the whole idea of unit testing is to focus only on the **smallest components** of your code.
_Instead, it is to try to think about how to test the entire application you are putting together_. In order to check
that your code works as expected, you should always think about the kind of tests you will be writing before you start
writing any code. You will be able to gain a lot of experience as you write more and more unit tests. You will be able
to understand what works and what may cause problems later on.

### Unit Test Structure

When structuring your project, you can follow some clear standards to make your application's code more accessible to
other Python developers. These simple rules are easy to apply and result in a uniform structure to make it easy to find
the test and code files you need.

- Unit tests should be placed under a `test/unit` directory at the top level of your project folder.
- All folders within the application's code should be mirrored by test folders under `test/unit`, which will have the
  unit tests for each file in them. For example, `app/data` should have a mirrored folder of `test/unit/app/data`.
- All unit test files should mirror the name of the file they are testing, with `_testas` the suffix. For example,
  `app/data/data_interface.py` should have a test file of `test/unit/app/data/data_interface_test.py`.

```text
.
├── README.md
├── src
├── __init__.py
├── add.py
└── test
    ├── __init__.py
    └── unit
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── test_add.py
        ├── test_module01.py
        ├── test_module02.py
        ├── test_module03.py
        └── test_module05.py


```

Note: The `__init__.py` files indicate that the folder is a Python package so that you can import them into other Python
files. For example, in `test_add.py`, you need to import methods from `add.py` so that you can test it.

### Using `unittest`

An example of a unit test program using a small calculator is considered to be one of the classic examples of unit
testing. The standard library of Python actually includes a lot of basic math functionality that can be used to do
mathematical calculations.

#### Example 1

The question is what would happen if you wrapped that into a simple-to-use command-line application that would perform
some simple calculations and could be run by anyone? It is the first scenario in the series that demonstrates how to
implement the calculator class of the earlier example of an application. Let's begin by looking at the `add()` method,
which looks something like this.

```python
# src/add.py

def addition(x, y):
    """Simple addition function"""
    return x + y

```

```python
# test/unit/test_add.py

import unittest

from src import add


class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add.addition(1, 5), 6)

```

In order to test the code, we will create a new file containing the test cases. A general convention is to use either
`filename_test.py` or `test_filename.py` to run the tests. In this case, we will use the `test_filename.py` file.

Code explanation:-

- We imported the `unittest` module and `add`.
- Created a class inheriting from `unittest.TestCase()`.
- Then we defined our test for the addition function. You must note that the method/function must start with `test_.`
- As a final step, we have used the `assertEqual` statement in order to verify equality.

To run a single test module, in this case `test_add.py`: First of all, make sure you are in the root directory of the
project.

```text
(venv) Sureshs-MBP:python-unit-testing-1 suresh$ ls
README.md       src             test

```

Run the following command in order to run the test: `python -m unittest test.unit.test_add`

This is the result that you should see when you run the program:

```text
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK

```

There is a list of assert statements available
on [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods) that you can use as per your
requirements. Below is a list
of some of the most common assert statements.

| Method                      | Checks for               |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `assertEqual(a, b)`         | a `==` b                 |
| `assertNotEqual(a, b)`      | a `!=` b                 |
| `assertTrue(x)`             | `bool(x)` `is` `True`    |
| `assertFalse(x)`            | `bool(x)` `is` `False`   |
| `assertIs(a, b)`            | a `is` b                 |
| `assertIsNot(a, b)`         | a `is` `not` b           |
| `assertIsNone(x)`           | x `is` `None`            |
| `assertIsNotNone(x)`        | x `is` `not` `None`      |
| `assertIn(a, b)`            | a `in` b                 |
| `assertNotIn(a, b)`         | a `not` `in` b           |
| `assertIsInstance(a, b)`    | `isinstance(a, b)`       |
| `assertNotIsInstance(a, b)` | `not` `isinstance(a, b)` |

#### Example 2

```python
# test/unit/test_module01.py
import unittest


class TestClass01(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_case_01(self):
        my_name_str = "Suresh Sigera "
        my_int = 1000
        self.assertTrue(isinstance(my_name_str, str))
        self.assertTrue(isinstance(my_int, int))

    def test_case_02(self):
        my_pi = 3.14
        self.assertFalse(isinstance(my_pi, int))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

- In the code above, the `import unittest` statement imports the unittest module. `TestClass01` is the test class. It is
  subclassed from the [TestCase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) class in the unittest module.
- The class methods `test_case01()` and `test_case02(`) are test methods, as their names start with test_ (Later in the
  lesson, you will learn about the guidelines and naming conventions that should be followed when writing tests).
- The `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` methods are assertion methods which check if the argument
  passed to them is `True` or `False`, respectively.
- If the argument meets the `assert` condition, the test case passes; otherwise, it fails. `unittest.main()` is the test
  runner. We will explore more assert methods in detail later.

Run the following command in order to run the test: `python3 -m unittest test.unit.test_module01 -v`

Since verbosity is disabled by default, the `-v` option will give you more detailed information about the test.

```text
(venv) Sureshs-MBP:unit suresh$ python3 -m unittest test.unit.test_module01 -v
test_case_01 (__main__.TestClass01) ... ok
test_case_02 (__main__.TestClass01) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.000s

OK
```

For a list of all the command-line options, use the following command `python3 –m unittest -h`

- `-h`, --help Show this message
- `-v`, --verbose Verbose output
- `-q`, --quiet Minimal output
- `-f`, --failfast Stop on first failure
- `-c`, --catch Catch control-C and display results
- `-b`, --buffer Buffer stdout and stderr during test runs

### Order of Execution of the Test Methods

```python
# test/unit/test_module02.py

import unittest
import inspect

debug = True


class TestClass02(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_case02(self):
        print("\nRunning Test Method : " + inspect.stack()[0][3])

    def test_case01(self):
        print("\nRunning Test Method : " + inspect.stack()[0][3])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)

```

It is important to note that no matter which order the test methods were listed in the code, the test methods ran in
alphabetical order. Using `inspect.stack()[0][3]`, you can print out the name of the test method that is currently
running. When debugging, you can use it to see which methods are executed in which order in the test class.

**How does it work?**

- `inspect.stack()` returns a list with frame records.
- The fourth element of the frame record (inspect.stack()[0][3]) is the function name.

```text
(venv) Sureshs-MBP:unit suresh$ python3 -m unittest test.unit.test_module01 -v
test_case01 (__main__.TestClass02) ... 
Running Test Method : test_case01
ok
test_case02 (__main__.TestClass02) ... 
Running Test Method : test_case02
ok

```

### Test Fixtures

A fixture is a set of resources needed for a test to be performed. Suppose, for example, that you are writing several
tests about the same class, and each of those tests needs an instance of that class for testing purposes in order to
run. Database connections and temporary files are other test fixtures that are often used. Many people would argue that
the use of external resources makes these tests not "unit tests", but they can still be useful tests even if they are
not "unit tests". It is pertinent to note that `TestCase` includes a hook that allows you to configure and clean up any
fixtures that your tests may require. In order to **_configure_** the fixtures, you will need to override the `setUp()`
method. In order to clean up, you need to override `tearDown()` to do so.

```python
# test/unit/test_module05.py

import unittest


class TestClass06(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        """called once, before any test"""
        print("In setUpClass()...")

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        """called once, after all tests, if setUpClass successful"""
        print("In tearDownClass()...")

    def setUp(self):
        """called multiple times, before every test method"""
        print("\nIn setUp()...")

    def tearDown(self):
        """called multiple times, after every test method"""
        print("In tearDown()...")

    def test_case01(self):
        self.assertTrue("PYTHON".isupper())
        print("In test_case01()")

    def test_case02(self):
        self.assertFalse("python".isupper())
        print("In test_case02()")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

- The `setUpModule()` and `tearDownModule()` methods are the module-level fixtures.
- `setUpModule()` method is executed before any method in the test `module.tearDownModule()` is executed after all
  methods in the test module.
- `setUpClass()` and `tearDownClass()` are class-level fixtures. `setUpClass()` is executed
  before any method in the test class. `tearDownClass()` is executed after all methods in the test class.

```python
# src/employee.py

class Employee:
    """Employee class"""

    def __init__(self, first, last):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last

    @property
    def email(self):
        return f'{self.first}{self.last}@email.com'

    @property
    def fullname(self):
        return f'{self.first.capitalize()} {self.last.capitalize()}'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    employee = Employee("Suresh", "Sigera")
    print(employee.fullname)

```

Now, whenever we create an instance of an employee with the first and last name, it will create the email and full name
of the employee automatically. This is because we enter the first and last names. As well, the employee's full name and
email address should be changed whenever the first or last name of the employee is changed.

```python
# test/unit/employee.py

import unittest
from src.employee import Employee


class TestEmployee(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_email(self):
        emp_1 = Employee('saral', 'gyaan')
        emp_2 = Employee('udit', 'vashisht')
        self.assertEqual(emp_1.email, 'saralgyaan@email.com')
        self.assertEqual(emp_2.email, 'uditvashisht@email.com')

        emp_1.first = "first"
        emp_2.first = "second"

        self.assertEqual(emp_1.email, 'firstgyaan@email.com')
        self.assertEqual(emp_2.email, 'secondvashisht@email.com')

    def test_fullname(self):
        emp_1 = Employee('saral', 'gyaan')
        emp_2 = Employee('udit', 'vashisht')
        self.assertEqual(emp_1.fullname, 'Saral Gyaan')
        self.assertEqual(emp_2.fullname, 'Udit Vashisht')

        emp_1.first = "first"
        emp_2.first = "second"

        self.assertEqual(emp_1.fullname, 'First Gyaan')
        self.assertEqual(emp_2.fullname, 'Second Vashisht')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

Running this will give the following output:-

```text
(venv) Sureshs-MBP:python-unit-testing-1 suresh$ python3 -m unittest test.unit.test_employee
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.000s

OK

```

The above test violates the **_DRY convention_** as we create instances of the individual for each test, and therefore
we are creating instances of the individual for each test. We can overcome this problem by using the `setUp`
and `tearDown` methods
in our code and modifying the code accordingly. It is not strictly necessary that we pass the tearDown method. This is
because it is only useful when testing involves the creation of files, databases, etc., and we want to be able to clean
them up at the end of the test and start over. It will be helpful if we add the `print()` function to our tests so that
we can illustrate how it works more clearly.

```python
# test/unit/employee.py

import unittest
from src.employee import Employee


class TestEmployee(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        print("Setting up!")
        self.emp_1 = Employee('saral', 'gyaan')
        self.emp_2 = Employee('udit', 'vashisht')

    def tearDown(self):
        print("Tearing down!\n")

    def test_email(self):
        print("Testing email.")
        self.assertEqual(self.emp_1.email, 'saralgyaan@email.com')
        self.assertEqual(self.emp_2.email, 'uditvashisht@email.com')

        self.emp_1.first = "first"
        self.emp_2.first = "second"

        self.assertEqual(self.emp_1.email, 'firstgyaan@email.com')
        self.assertEqual(self.emp_2.email, 'secondvashisht@email.com')

    def test_fullname(self):
        print("Testing Full Name.")
        self.assertEqual(self.emp_1.fullname, 'Saral Gyaan')
        self.assertEqual(self.emp_2.fullname, 'Udit Vashisht')

        self.emp_1.first = "first"
        self.emp_2.first = "second"

        self.assertEqual(self.emp_1.fullname, 'First Gyaan')
        self.assertEqual(self.emp_2.fullname, 'Second Vashisht')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Output:-

```text
(venv) Sureshs-MBP:python-unit-testing-1 suresh$ python3 -m unittest test.unit.test_employee
Setting up!
Testing email.
Tearing down!

.Setting up!
Testing Full Name.

.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.000s

OK

```

The output shows that the `setUp` method is called before all tests, and the `tearDown` method is called after all
tests. This could be useful if you are running multiple tests.

Some of the use-cases might require that some code be run before the unit tests are run as well as some code to be run
after the unit tests are run so that some code is run before and after the unit tests are run. In such a scenario, you
can use two `class` methods named `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass`.

### Ignoring broken tests

There are times when a test is known to fail, but we do not want the test suite to report that failure to the user. The
reason for this may be that a broken or unfinished feature already has tests written. However, we aren't focusing on
improving it right now in order to fix it. There are many reasons why this occurs. The most common reason is that a
certain feature does not exist on a specific platform, Python version, or in an advanced version of a certain library.
As a Python user, it is possible to use a few decorators to mark tests with the expectation that they will fail. This
can enable you to skip them if conditions are known to occur.

These decorators are as follows:

- `expectedFailure()`
- `skip(reason)`
- `skipIf(condition, reason)`
- `skipUnless(condition, reason)`

The `skip` method goes one step further and doesn't even bother to run the test. In order to skip the test, it expects
only one string argument describing the reason why it was omitted. The other two decorators accept two arguments, one a
Boolean expression that indicates whether or not the test should be run, and a similar description. In use, these three
decorators might be applied as they are in the following code:

```python
import unittest
import sys


class SkipTests(unittest.TestCase):
    @unittest.expectedFailure
    def test_fails(self):
        self.assertEqual(False, True)

    @unittest.skip("Test is useless")
    def test_skip(self):
        self.assertEqual(False, True)

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info.minor == 4, "broken on 3.4")
    def test_skipif(self):
        self.assertEqual(False, True)

    @unittest.skipUnless(
        sys.platform.startswith("linux"), "broken unless on linux"
    )
    def test_skip_unless(self):
        self.assertEqual(False, True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Running this using `python3 -m unittest test.unit.test_skip -v` will give the following output:-

```text
test_fails (test.unit.test_skip.SkipTests) ... expected failure
test_skip (test.unit.test_skip.SkipTests) ... skipped 'Test is useless'
test_skip_if (test.unit.test_skip.SkipTests) ... FAIL
test_skip_unless (test.unit.test_skip.SkipTests) ... skipped 'broken unless on linux'

======================================================================
FAIL: test_skip_if (test.unit.test_skip.SkipTests)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/suresh/Documents/ga/abbott/python-unit-testing-1/test/unit/test_skip.py", line 16, in test_skip_if
    self.assertEqual(False, True)
AssertionError: False != True

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.000s

FAILED (failures=1, skipped=2, expected failures=1)
```

The `x` on the first line indicates an expected failure; the two `s` characters represent skipped tests, and the `F`
indicates a real failure, since the conditional to `skipUnless` was True on my system.
